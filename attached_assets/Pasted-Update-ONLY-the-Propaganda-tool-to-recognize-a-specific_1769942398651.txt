Update ONLY the Propaganda tool to recognize a specific uploaded screenshot and show a deterministic “propaganda analysis” output, similar to how Fact Check recognizes the Sensex screenshot.

DEMO TRIGGER (Propaganda only, filename-based; no OCR)
- If uploaded file name contains any of these (case-insensitive):
  - "25001"
  - OR "quiet_hour"
  - OR "gossamer_ledger"
then force a known propaganda-case output.

RECOMMENDED TEST FILE NAME
- prop_quiet_hour_25001.png

DETERMINISTIC OUTPUT (Propaganda tab UI)
Show a “Propaganda Assessment: HIGH” / CRITICAL style result with:
- Propaganda Score: 78% (or 75–85%)
- Risk Level: CRITICAL
- Decision default: REJECT
- Fake/Real language must NOT be used here; call it “propaganda likelihood / rhetorical manipulation risk”.

EVIDENCE (must display in UI as extracted evidence)
Use these exact excerpts in the UI under “Evidence excerpts”:
- Source header: "The Gossamer Ledger"
- Headline: "QUIET HOUR ORDINANCE: 'FOR YOUR SAFETY,' OR FOR THEIR CONTROL?"
- Byline/date: "By A. Thorne | October 26, 2023"
- Commentary:
  1) "Is 'quiet' just code for compliance?"
  2) "Don't let them turn down the volume on your rights."
  3) "The silence they seek is the silence of submission."

INDICATORS FOUND (hard-coded list shown as chips/bullets)
- Loaded framing / rhetorical question (“for your safety…or for their control?”)
- Call-to-action language (“Don’t let them…”)
- ‘They’/oppressor framing (“The silence they seek…”)
- Emotional appeal / fear of suppression (“silence of submission”)

KEEP EXISTING PROPAGANDA LOGIC FOR OTHER FILES
- For all non-trigger uploads, keep the current propaganda scoring logic unchanged (the keyword/indicator system you already implemented).
- Do not touch Document, Fact Check, Verification tabs.

EXPORT REPORT
For this triggered file, include in JSON under propaganda:
{
  trigger: "filename:25001",
  score: 78,
  riskLevel: "CRITICAL",
  indicatorsFound: [...],
  evidenceExcerpts: [...],
  matchedFacts: []   // can be empty
}

CONSTRAINTS
- Minimal diff, no new hex colors outside tokens.css, token-only styling.
- Manual Review must remain ONLY for medium-risk results; since this is CRITICAL, no manual-review action should appear.
