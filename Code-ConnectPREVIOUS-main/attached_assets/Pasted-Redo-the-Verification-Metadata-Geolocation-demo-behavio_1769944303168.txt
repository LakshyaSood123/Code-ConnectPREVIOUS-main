Redo the Verification (Metadata + Geolocation) demo behavior to match the current UI shown in the screenshot.

CURRENT UI (must keep)
- The Verification tab is “Verification Suite” with the big dropzone and the helper tip text.
- It already has two inputs at the bottom:
  1) CLAIMED LOCATION (left)
  2) CLAIMED EVENT (OPTIONAL) (right)
- Keep layout + spacing the same (do not redesign).

WHAT TO CHANGE
A) Remove the old “_REAL / _FAKE” hint for Verification
- In the tip line under the dropzone, replace:
  “TIP: NAME FILES WITH _REAL OR _FAKE FOR DEMO OUTPUTS”
  with something Verification-specific, e.g.:
  “TIP: Use demo filenames like quake_turkey_32001.jpg, flood_kanchipuram_33001.jpg, eiffel_31001.jpg”
- Verification must NOT use _real/_fake logic at all.

B) Verification logic must use:
1) Uploaded file name -> predicted location + predicted event (hard-coded demo)
2) Compare predicted vs CLAIMED LOCATION and CLAIMED EVENT
3) Produce MATCH / MISMATCH / INSUFFICIENT result

DETERMINISTIC TRIGGERS (filename based; case-insensitive)
1) Eiffel / Paris case (GOOD)
- If filename contains: "eiffel" OR "paris" OR "31001"
  predictedLocation = "Paris, France"
  predictedEvent = "landmark photo"
  confidence = 0.94
  reasons = ["Landmark match: Eiffel Tower silhouette", "Urban skyline consistent with Paris"]

2) Earthquake Turkey case (MISMATCH when claim is India)
- If filename contains: "quake_turkey" OR "turkey_32001" OR "32001"
  predictedLocation = "Kahramanmaras, Turkey"
  predictedEvent = "earthquake"
  confidence = 0.88
  reasons = ["Reference match: earthquake scene (demo)", "Context cues consistent with quake aftermath (demo)"]

3) Flood Kanchipuram case (MATCH when claim is Kanchipuram/Tamil Nadu/India)
- If filename contains: "flood_kanchipuram" OR "kanchipuram" OR "tamilnadu" OR "33001"
  predictedLocation = "Kanchipuram District, Tamil Nadu, India"
  predictedEvent = "flood"
  confidence = 0.90
  reasons = ["Reference match: flood aerial inundation (demo)", "Urban inundation context consistent with district flooding (demo)"]

DEFAULT (unknown)
- Else:
  predictedLocation = "Unknown"
  predictedEvent = "Unknown"
  confidence = 0.35
  reasons = ["Insufficient cues for reliable verification (demo)"]

MATCHING RULES (use the existing two inputs)
Normalize all strings: lowercase, trim, collapse spaces, remove punctuation.

Location match:
- If predictedLocation = "Unknown": matchStatus="insufficient" risk=55 decision=MANUAL_REVIEW
- Else if claimedLocation empty: matchStatus="insufficient" risk=50 decision=MANUAL_REVIEW
- Else:
