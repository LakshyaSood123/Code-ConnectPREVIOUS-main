Merge the “Metadata” and “Geolocation” tabs into a single tab/tool, with minimal diff and keeping the existing UI style and logic.

NEW TAB
- Replace the two tabs “Metadata” and “Geolocation” with ONE tab named: “Verification”
  (icon can be reused from either; keep consistent styling)

INSIDE THE NEW “VERIFICATION” TOOL (single upload UI)
- Keep a single drag-and-drop upload area (same as current Metadata/Geo).
- After upload + processing, show ONE combined result view that contains TWO sections:

Section A: “Metadata Analysis”
- Use the existing Metadata demo logic and bullets:
  - filename contains "_fake" => suspicious metadata bullets (edited software, EXIF mismatch, timestamp anomaly)
  - filename contains "_real" => clean metadata bullets
  - otherwise => partial/needs review bullets

Section B: “Geolocation Verification”
- Use the existing Geolocation demo logic and bullets:
  - "_fake" => low confidence, “No reliable match”
  - "_real" => high confidence, “High-confidence location verification”
  - otherwise => medium confidence, “Needs review”

RESULT SUMMARY / DECISION
- Produce one overall combined decision and risk score for the uploaded file:
  - If either section is CRITICAL (e.g., _fake) => overall REJECT, high risk (90–95)
  - If both are LOW (e.g., _real) => overall APPROVE, low risk (10–15)
  - Else => MANUAL REVIEW, medium risk (50–65)

KPI COUNTS
- Ensure KPI cards and Export Report use this combined result and update counts correctly.

EXPORT REPORT
- Include both metadata + geolocation subsections in the exported JSON under the same result item:
  {
    ...,
    metadata: {...},
    geolocation: {...}
  }

CLEANUP
- Remove unused Geolocation/Metadata components/routes/state if they become dead code.
- Update any labels/tool list ordering so it’s: Document, Fact Check, Propaganda, Verification

CONSTRAINTS
- Minimal diff.
- No new hex colors outside tokens.css; use var(--...) only.
- Keep processing/toast behavior unchanged.
