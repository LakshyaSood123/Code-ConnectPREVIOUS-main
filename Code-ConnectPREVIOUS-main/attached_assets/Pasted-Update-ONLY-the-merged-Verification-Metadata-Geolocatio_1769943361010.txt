Update ONLY the merged Verification (Metadata + Geolocation) tool to support “Claimed Location vs Predicted Location” checks.

UI CHANGE (Verification tab only)
- Under the upload dropzone, add a small input:
  Label: "Claimed location"
  Placeholder: "e.g., India, New Delhi"
- Optional second input:
  Label: "Claimed event"
  Placeholder: "e.g., earthquake, flood, protest"

CORE BEHAVIOR
1) Determine a “Predicted location” deterministically (demo/hard-coded):
- Use filename-based triggers (case-insensitive) to map the uploaded file to a predicted location:
  - if filename contains "eiffel" OR "paris" OR "31001" -> predicted = "Paris, France", confidence=0.94, reason=["Landmark match: Eiffel Tower"]
  - if filename contains "quake_turkey" OR "turkey_32001" -> predicted = "Kahramanmaras, Turkey", confidence=0.88, reason=["Reference match: earthquake coverage image set", "Urban + rubble context consistent"]
  - if filename contains "quake_japan" OR "japan_32002" -> predicted = "Sendai, Japan", confidence=0.86, reason=["Reference match: earthquake image set"]
  - if filename contains "quake_india" OR "india_32003" -> predicted = "Uttarakhand, India", confidence=0.82, reason=["Reference match: India quake image set"]
  - else predicted = "Unknown", confidence=0.35, reason=["Insufficient visual cues (demo)"]

2) Compare claimed vs predicted
- Normalize strings: lowercase, trim, remove punctuation and extra spaces.
- Determine mismatch:
  - If predicted is "Unknown": set riskScore=55 (MEDIUM), decision=MANUAL_REVIEW, message="Cannot confirm location; insufficient cues."
  - Else if claimedLocation is empty: set riskScore=50 (MEDIUM), decision=MANUAL_REVIEW, message="Provide a claimed location to verify."
  - Else if claimedLocation does NOT contain the predicted country OR key city token:
      -> mismatch = true
      -> riskScore=85 (CRITICAL)
      -> decision=REJECT
      -> message: "Claim mismatch: Not consistent with predicted location."
  - Else:
      -> match = true
      -> riskScore=12 (LOW)
      -> decision=APPROVE
      -> message: "Claim consistent with predicted location."

3) Output UI (Verification tab)
- Show a section “Claim vs Location Check” with:
  - Claimed: <user input>
  - Predicted: <predicted location> (confidence %)
  - Result badge: MATCH / MISMATCH / INSUFFICIENT DATA
  - “Why” list using the reason[] strings
- Keep existing metadata panel (exifStatus/editTraces/timestamp) but it can remain demo-hardcoded.
- Ensure Manual Review option appears ONLY for MEDIUM risk (already implemented globally).

EXPORT REPORT
- Include for Verification:
  verification: {
    claimedLocation,
    claimedEvent,
    predictedLocation,
    confidence,
    matchStatus: "match"|"mismatch"|"insufficient",
    reasons:[...]
  }

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT modify Document, Fact Check, Propaganda logic.
- Minimal diff; token-only colors; no new hex colors outside tokens.css.
