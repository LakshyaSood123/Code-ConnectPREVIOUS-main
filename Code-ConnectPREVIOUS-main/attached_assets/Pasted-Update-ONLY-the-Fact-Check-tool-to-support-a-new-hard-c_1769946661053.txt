Update ONLY the Fact Check tool to support a new hard-coded demo case for the uploaded screenshot about “Doom 64 / Aubrey Hodges”, and force it to be MEDIUM risk so it lands in MANUAL REVIEW.

IMPORTANT
- Keep the current Fact Check UI pattern “extracting data / claims / evidence” the same as your existing hard-coded fact-check examples.
- Fact Check already accepts FILE uploads (not text). Keep that behavior.
- Use filename-based recognition (NO OCR). Minimal diff. No new hex colors outside tokens.css.

1) ADD NEW FACT-CHECK DEMO TRIGGER (filename-based)
When an uploaded file’s name contains ANY of:
- "doom64"
- "aubrey"
- "hodges"
- "ongaku"
- "fact_42001"

Treat it as this specific fact-check case:
caseId: "FACT_DOOM64_42001"
displayTitle: "Article claim review: Doom 64 / Aubrey Hodges"
riskScore: 58  (MEDIUM)
decision: MANUAL_REVIEW  (must be manual review)
priorityLabel: "MEDIUM"
matchBadge: "NEEDS REVIEW"

2) HARDCODED “EXTRACTED CONTENT” (show in the Fact Check results panel)
Populate the same structured output you already use (entities, claims, evidence, notes):

Extracted Entities (demo)
- Aubrey Hodges (game composer)
- Doom 64 (Nintendo 64 shooter)
- Nintendo 64
- Midway
- id Software
- Nightdive Studios
- The Ongaku (republisher / source label)

Key Claims (demo)
1. “Aubrey Hodges created a classic dark ambient score for the Nintendo 64 shooter Doom 64, revisiting it ~20 years later for an augmented album release.”
2. “Doom 64 is not the 64th game in the Doom series.”
3. “Doom 64 was developed by Midway with oversight from id Software.”
4. “The game recently got a fresh port for PC and consoles by Nightdive Studios.”

Evidence (demo / hard-coded cards)
- Evidence Card A: “Publisher/credits snippet present in screenshot (The Ongaku republish line).”
- Evidence Card B: “Known franchise info usually requires a reliable external source (developer/publisher credits).”
- Evidence Card C: “Port claim requires verification against release notes / store listing.”

Why MANUAL REVIEW (must be shown clearly)
- “Multiple factual claims; some require external confirmation (credits, release timing, port details).”
- “Screenshot is partial; not enough context to confirm all claims.”
- “Marking as MEDIUM risk to route to analyst review (demo).”

Verdict (demo)
- status: "Likely credible but needs manual verification"
- confidence: 0.62
- recommendedAction: "Manual Review"

3) MAKE SURE IT APPEARS IN MANUAL REVIEW TAB (global behavior)
- Because riskScore is MEDIUM, ensure this item is included in:
  - Analysis Summary: Manual Review count increments by +1
  - Manual Review tab/list: include a row/card for this case
- Ensure that low/high risk items DO NOT show manual review actions (already implemented rule). This one MUST show manual review.

4) SHOW IMAGE PREVIEW IN RESULTS (not filename)
- In Fact Check “Detailed Results”, display the uploaded screenshot thumbnail/preview (bigger preview per earlier change), and show the title + risk badge.
- Keep filename text small/subtle, but prioritize the image preview.

5) EXPORT REPORT INCLUDES THIS FACT CHECK DATA
- When exporting, include a “factCheck” entry with:
  { caseId, extractedEntities, keyClaims, evidenceCards, verdict, confidence, decision, riskScore }

6) RECOMMENDED TEST FILENAME (for me to demo)
- doom64_fact_42001.jpg

CONSTRAINTS
- Don’t touch Document / Propaganda / Verification tools.
- No new hex colors outside tokens.css.
- Keep layout, spacing, and typography unchanged.
